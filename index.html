                        <p class = "lead"> Sustainable global development depends on SDG 16, which is centered on justice, peace, and strong institutions. By lowering violence, fighting corruption, guaranteeing equitable access to justice, and creating strong, transparent, and responsible institutions at all levels, it seeks to advance inclusive and peaceful societies. This objective acknowledges that sustainable development is impossible without human rights, peace, stability, and efficient governance. By focusing on issues like lowering all types of violence, putting an end to abuse, exploitation, and trafficking, and advancing the rule of law, it lays the groundwork for resolving structural injustices, safeguarding marginalized groups, and fostering conditions that allow for social and economic advancement. It highlights that development is about building societies where everyone can live with opportunity, security, and dignity rather than merely focusing on economic growth.

                        <h2> My Views on SDG16</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p class="lead"> Do you remember Kian? Kian was just a normal child outside his home to meet up with his friends. But one night, gunshots rang out. Shots that ended the dreams of an unsuspecting Kian. This was one of the problems that echoed during the previous administration. He was one of the innocent lives lost due to baseless anti-drug operations. Justice was achieved for him, but what if this happens again? <br><br>
                        Isn't it heartbreaking? An innocent individual lost their life by being caught in an operation. One of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) is peace, justice, and good governance. Its primary aim is to prevent chaos in the world. If we do nothing, people can easily be divided. If we do nothing, what will happen to the next generation? Will we let them live in a world where there are always conflicts and disputes? Will we let them live consumed by hatred for one another? Because one of the reasons for conflict is the lack of understanding between people of different races. Misunderstandings due to different perspectives and beliefs that lead to chaos.
                        Let's go back to Kian, let's say he was a victim of discrimination. Because they are poor, they are immediately suspected of being a "drug addict". There's always discrimination that ultimately results in the loss of one or more lives. Another aspect of this SDG is corruption. We cannot deny that our country is home to corrupt government officials. Instead of the money going to important projects like health, education, infrastructure, and many others, it goes into their pockets. <br><br> How can this be solved? How can this be stopped?
                        The solutions are simple. Let's enforce the law and take steps to address the excessive loss of innocent lives in police operations. Support those fighting against corrupt politicians. Spread the message on social media to avoid discrimination against different beliefs, races, or life circumstances. And in the coming election, be critical, collaborate, and recognize who we will vote for. And don't be swayed by money. The future of our community is in our hands, so let's help each other and together fix our society.</p>
